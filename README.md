ergonomic split keyboard

compact layout but includes all the needed keys for gaming (like customisable keys) and programming (like proper arrow keys)

when connecting the 2 halfs it is like a standard keyboard (not everybody needs ergonomy)

uses standard USB HID Keyboard protocol (no drivers needed)

wired to be fast in games

right half can be detached to create space for the mouse

the 3 custom keys can be configured anytime to any key (even from the right side: now is much faster to start marine training at barracks or probes construction at nexus)

adjustable keys back light (several animations provided; light intensity configurable)

compatible with Cherry Mx mechanical keys
